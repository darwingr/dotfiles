# .profile
#
# Sourced by login shells.
#
# A POSIX-compliant profile.
# Bash will source this on login shells (and .bash_profile).
# ZSH will only source this if called as sh or ksh,
# or explicitly called from .zprofile using:
# [[ -e ~/.profile ]] && emulate sh -c 'source ~/.profile'
#echo "Sourcing ~/.profile"
